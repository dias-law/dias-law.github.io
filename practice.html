<li>
<b>Lack of life jackets</b>, which save hundreds of individuals who fall off boats and cannot swim or tread water</li>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Liability for Injuries – Who can be held responsible for my injuries?</h2>
<p>Car Fires are a leading cause of burn injuries that may result in permanent scarring and disfigurement</p>
Liability for your injuries, can depend on a number of different factors. Where the injury took place, how it occurred and what steps were taken to avoid injuries. With lodging or hotel fires, the establishment is generally held liable. However, depending on who or what caused the fire, their liability may be limited.

Depending on the aforementioned issues, liability can be imposed on a number of parties and it is important to clearly understand your rights.
<h2></h2>
<h2>What are the degrees of a burn injury?</h2>
<p>Burn injuries have multiple degrees. The most common degree of burn injuries are first-degree through fourth-degree burns. An explanation of each of these injuries are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>First Degree Burns: 1st</strong> degree burns from barbeque accidents are common. 1st degree burns are categorized as those having the least amount of penetration through the skin. <strong> </strong>These are considered the least dangerous or hurtful. First degree burns rarely ever leave scars.</li>
<li>
<strong>Second Degree Burns: 2nd</strong> degree burns generally cause a greater level of discomfort. Signs of second degree burns include blistering of the skin. This usually happens when the contact with the chemical, heat or other substance penetrates through the skin. Usually those suffering from 2nd degree burns require medical attention. Barbecue defects will likely cause 2nd degree burns or greater. It is important to seek medical attention when suffering from this level of burns.</li>
<li>
<strong>Third Degree Burns: 3rd</strong> degree burns are those that penetrate through the skin causing serious damage. These types of burns occur from electrocution, or serious prolonged exposure to heat or fire. 3rd degree burns require extensive medical attention and can be life-threatening. These types of injuries often require cosmetic surgery to have them correct.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fourth Degree Burns: 4th</strong> degree burns penetrate beneath the skin and lead to muscle damage. These types of burns are often life-threatening and if not treated promptly will lead to death. Often times even those who seek timely medical attention die shortly after exposure.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fifth Degree Burns: 5th</strong> degree burns, are those that penetrate to the bone. These types of burns are fatal and do not leave survivors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sixth Degree Burns: 6th</strong> degree burns, much like 5th degree burns are unlikely to leave survivors. Unfortunately these types of injuries are so severe that they leave the body un-identifiable</li>
</ul>
You should not attempt to diagnose your degree of burns yourself. It is important to have a qualified professional make this determination. If you have been injured seek medical treatment for your injuries.

The rental car agency is a booming business that is present the world over. As a whole, the business generates about <b>$42 billion in income</b>; in the country, there are <b>22,000 rental agencies alone</b>. Most of the individuals who rent vehicles are <b>between the ages of 25 and 34</b>. Older individuals tend to own their vehicles and younger individuals are not always legally allowed to rent. Rentals are often used by visitors to major cities. For example, airports generally have rental car agencies attached to the building or located inside so that customers can quickly pick up or drop off vehicles. It can be expensive for visitors to take public transportation every day or use Uber or Lyft to get around, and renting a car may be much cheaper, especially if the cost is split between a few individuals. Many high-population cities that are also popular tourist attractions have a few different rental car services available for out-of-towners. Rental cars are also driven by people who are in between vehicles or whose cars are currently in need of repair. Insurance companies may provide temporary vehicles to their customers if an accident totaled the car or sent it to the shop for an extended period of time. Additionally, businesses and corporations may provide rental cars to their workers or to customers as a way to guarantee transportation. A few of the most prominent rental car agencies are:
<ul>
<li>Avis</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Enterprise</li>
<li>Fox Rent A Car</li>
<li>Thrifty</li>
<li>Traffic</li>
<li>Advantage</li>
<li>National</li>
<li>Alamo</li>
<li>Dollar</li>
<li>Hertz</li>

<h2>Motor Vehicle Accidents Are More Common Than You Think</h2>
<p>The roads are always bustling with motor vehicles speeding to their destination. Even though traffic regulations are there to prevent motor vehicle accidents and keep order on the road, it is simply not possible. Human beings are notably bad drivers. That includes you. Even if you’ve never been in an accident and consider yourself a good driver, our short attention spans and slow reaction times will inevitably get you involved in an accident. To err is human. When you get in an accident, insurance companies will resolve who’s fault it was: <strong>Motor vehicle accidents can actually hold one or more persons responsible, which could then be legally scrutinized for proper analysis.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>How do you classify motor vehicle accidents?</strong></h3>
<p>Any accident or mishap that happened with the involvement of any road vehicle can be considered a motor vehicle accident. The most frightening thing about motor vehicle accidents is that they could happen virtually anytime, anywhere, to anyone — with even a few cases happening off-road. Causes of motor vehicle accidents vary greatly. Human error is by far the most common: texting, talking, daydreaming, etc. There are then more complex reasons such as mechanical failures and faults in vehicle design.</p>
<h3>Assessment of the damage caused by motor vehicle accidents</h3>
<p>Just like any other kind of accident, assessment of the damage is always given the higher priority. In rare instances, the compilation of damages can be extensive, but is usually divided into four general categories.</p>
<h3>Knowing who should be the one responsible</h3>
<p>Knowing who was directly responsible for the accident usually requires legal action. Filing for a motor vehicle accident lawsuit won’t be as easy as you might expect in the litigious USA. The reason it is not so easy to file a lawsuit is because there are often many factors in an accident. That is why you’ll need the expert law services of the Dias Law Firm, Inc..

<h1>Leading Cause of Self-Driving Car Accidents</h1>
With the advent of new technology, drivers on the road are <b>becoming more acquainted with a sensory overload</b>. They must be more interactive than before due to the abundance of touch screens present in cars and the interconnection of personal devices and their vehicles. It is no surprise that <b>self driving cars</b> are leading to some issues and accidents; there is always a period of adjustment that comes with new and unfamiliar technology and transportation. If you are involved in a self driving car accident, whether as the operator or as a fellow driver, you can sue the responsible party for compensation for any injuries and damages you suffered. The fault could lie with the manufacturer of the vehicle, another individual on the road, the person inside the autonomous car, the company who put the self driving vehicle on the road, and more. Our team of attorneys at the Dias Law Firm, Inc. in Los Angeles, California, will be able to assist you.
<h2></h2>
<h2>Information on Self Driving Cars</h2>
<b>Self driving cars</b> function with the use of artificial intelligence, algorithms to recognize the surrounding area and objects, sensors to determine proximity and speed of other vehicles and objects, data management, the internet, radar, GPS, connectivity, and more. They have slowly been <b>getting more and more popular</b> and have been introduced to the roads on both a personal and a commercial level. The level of autonomy the car has dictates how much input it needs from a human. Some cars only have basic forms of autonomy, such as cruise control, but others can fully navigate roads and keep the drivers relatively safe. Many of these cars, however, have alerts that indicate that a driver should take control for that instance. Some self driving cars have been put on the road by companies like <b>Uber</b> and <b>Google</b>. Uber has experimented with the vehicles to put even more transportation on the road, but an accident resulted in the death of a woman – she was crossing the road at night with her bicycle beside her when a self driving car struck her. The woman in the self driving car was <i>not paying adequate attention</i> and <i>could not stop the accident from occurring</i>.
